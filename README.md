# Why this repo and how to use it
This repository is a tentative to experiment how to teach some fun informatics to a kid with disability. It will be mainly experimental, grouping different ideas and linking to the work of other people, it will also possibly contain coding games or whatever interests Benny!

It will be in Italian, because it will be used for an italian kid. It is provided as open-source under the MIT Licence.

A possible translation will be provided to anyone that is interested. Also collaborations of any kind is welcome.

# Development rules and languages
